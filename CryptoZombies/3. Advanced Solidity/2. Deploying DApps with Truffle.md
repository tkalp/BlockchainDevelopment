## Truffle
- Most popular blockchain development framework
- Packed with lots of useful features
	- Easy smart contract compilation
	- automated ABI generation
	- Integrated smart contract testing
		- Support for **Mocha** and **Chai**
	- Support for multiple networks
		- Rinkeby, **Ethereum** or even to Loom

```bash
npm install truffle -g 
```

### Getting Started
- In order to initalize a truffle project, we have to run the command

```bash
truffle init
```

- This will create a set of folders that looks like the following structure

```
├── contracts
  ├── Migrations.sol
├── migrations
	├── 1_initial_migrations.js
└── test
truffle-config.js
truffle.js
```

#### Truffle's Default Directory Structure

`contracts`
- This is the place where Truffle expects to find all our smart contracts. 
- In order to keep the code organized, we can create nested folders such as `contracts/folders`
- **Note:** `truffle init` should automatically created the `Migrations.sol` contract

`migrations`
- A migration is a JavaScript file that tells **Truffle** how to deploy a smart contract

`test`
- This is where the unit tests go
	- Can be composed on JavaScript or Solidity
- Once a contract is deployed, it cannot be changed, making it essential that we test our smart contracts before we deploy them

`truffle.js` and `truffle-config.js`
- Config files to store the network settings for deployment
- Needs to have two config files because on Windows having both `truffle.js` and `truffle.exe` in the same folder causes conflicts
	- If you are using windows, delete `truffle.js` and use `truffle-config.js`
- <a href="https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration" target= "_blank">Truffle Config Documentation</a>

- It is important to note to keep the file structure as is for two reasons
	- Truffle will not work as expected if you change it
	- Adhering to the standards will allow other developers to understand what is happening

#### truffle-hdwaller-provider
- We can use *Infura* to deploy code to **Ethereum** as well for these notes
- We can run the application without needing to set up our own Ethereum node or waller
- However, *Infura* does not manage the private keys
	- Can't sign transactions on our behalf
- We need to use `truffle-hdwallet-provider` to allow `Truffle` to sign our transactions

```bash
npm install truffle-hdwallet-provier
```
- Make sure you do this AFTER `npm install truffle` 
	- This is due to truffle expecting an empty directory on init

### Compiling the Source Code
- The **Ethereum Virtual Machine** can't directly understand Soldiity source code as we write it
- Thus we need to run a compiler that will "translate" our smart contract into machine-readable bytecode
- The VM will then execute the byecode and complete the actions required by the smart contract

#### Using the solidity compiler
- Devs managed to bake in some **nifty** features to compiler
- Imagine we wanted to modify the definintion of `add` in `SafeMath`

```solidity
function add(uint16 a, uint16 b) internal returns (uint16){
	uint16 c = a + b;
	assert(c >= a);
	return c;
}
```

- If we try to compile this, the compiler will throw a warning 

`Function state mutability can be restricted to view`

- What the compiler does is say that our function does not read or write from/to the blockchain and that we should use the `pure` modifier

Why is this important?
- Making a `pure` or `view` function saves us some gas
- These functions do not modify the state of the block, there is no need for miners to execute them
- To put it in a few words, `pure` and `view` functioned can be `call`ed for free

#### Compiling
- We need to put all of the contracts we have written into a contract folder
- We can then run `truffle compile` which will then create the build artifacts and place them in the `./build/contracts`
- For example, prior to compile we have the following structure

```
├── contracts
  ├── Migrations.sol
  ├── CrytoZombies.sol
  ├── erc721.sol
  ├── ownable.sol
  ├── safemath.sol
  ├── zombieattack.sol
  ├── zombiefactory.sol
  ├── zombiefeeding.sol
  ├── zombiehelper.sol
  ├── zombieownership.sol
├── migrations
	├── 1_initial_migrations.js
└── test
truffle-config.js
truffle.js
```

- Then we can run `truffle compile` and have our build artifacts

### Migrations
- Now before we deploy to the Ethereum network, we need to be testing constantly
	- Once the contract is on the network, we cannot change it
	- This is covered in the previous notes
	- So we can focus on deployment here
- In order to deploy to Ethereum, we will have to create a migration
- Migrations
	- JavaScript files that help **Truffle** deploy the code to Ethereum
	- This is related to the `Migrations.sol` file that was created on `truffle init`
	- The code keeps tracks of changes we make to the code
	- The way it works is that the history of changes is saved onchain
		- So that you will never deploy the same code twice

#### Creating a New Migration
- If we look at the `1_initial_migrations.js`, we see the following code

```javascript
var Migrations = artifacts.require("./Migrations.sol");
module.exports = function(deployer) {
	deployer.deploy(Migrations)
}
```

1. The script tells Truffle that we want to interact with the `Migrations` contract
2. Exports a function that accepts an object called `deployer` as a parameter. This object acts as an interface between the developer and Truffle's deployement engine
	- <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations">Documentation</a>
3. So now we just need to do this for our contract, something like 

```javascript
var CryptoZombies = artifacts.require("./CryptoZombies.sol");
module.exports = function(deployer) {
	deployer.deploy(CryptoZombies);
}
```

### Configuration Files

#### Ethereum Test Networks
- Several public **Ethereum** test networks let you test your contracts for free before you deploy them to the main net
	- Once its deployed to the mainnet, it cannot be altered
	- These test networks usually use a different consensus algorithm to the main net (usually PoA)
	- Ether is free to encourage thourough testing
- For example, we can use `Rinkeby`

#### Truffle's HD Wallet Provider
- This is used to help Truffle sign transactions
- Now we want to edit our configuration file to use `HDWalletProvider`

```javascript
var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");
// we also need our mnemonic
var mnemonic = "onions carrots beans...."
```

- **IMPORTANT**
	- DO NOT STORE YOUR MNEUMONIC IN THE ACTUAL SCRIPT AS A STATIC VARIABLE
	- This should read from some file that gets ignored by gitignore
	- It cannot be publicly available

- Our truffle.js should look like this for **Rinkeby**

```javascript
const HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");
// we also need our mnemonic
const mnemonic = readFromFileFunction("./mnemonic.txt");

// Module exports to make this configuration available to truffle itself
module.exports = {
	networks: {
		mainnet: {
			provider: function(){
				return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
			},
			network_id: 1 // this is the mainnet id
		}

		rinkeby: {
			provider: function(){
				return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
			},
			network_id: 4 // this is the rinkeby id
		}
	}
}
```

### Deploying Our Smart Contract
#### Migrations
- Sounds like moving stuff around
- Actually just a JavaScript file telling Truffle how to modify the state of our smart contracts
- Provide a convenient way to keep track of the changes you make to the code
- If we want to deploy more than one contract, a seperate migration file must be created for each contract
	- Migrations are always executed in order - 1,2,3, etc
- For this example, we will start with Rinkeby.
	- This is good practice before deploying to the main net

#### Getting some test Ether
- Before the deployment, make sure there is enough Ether in your account
- The best way to get Ether for testing purposes is through a service called a `faucet`
	- <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io">Authenticated Faucet</a>

LETS DEPLOY USING

```bash
truffle migrate --network rinkeby
```

Can also use `deploy` instead of `migrate`

BOOM ITS DEPLOYED NOW

### Use Truffle with Loom
#### What is Loom BaseChain?
- Ethereum has gas fees for every transaction
- But this is not ideal for a user-facing DApp or a game
- Can easily ruin the user experience

- On **Loom**, your users can have much speedier and gas-free transactions, making it a much better fit for games and other non-financial application
- Deploying to **Loom** is no different from deploying to Rinkeby, or to the main net
	- If you know how to do one, you can do the other

#### loom-truffle-provider
- A provider developed by the CryptoZombie developers
- The provider works like a bridge that makes Web3 calls compatible with **Loom**
	- No need to understand how it works under the hood!

```bash
npm install loom-truffle-provider
```

#### Deploy to Loom Testnet
- We first have to make the **Loom** private key
	- We have to first download it <a href="https://loomx.io/developers/en/basic-install-all.html">here</a>
- Now to create a private key we run the command

```bash
$./loom genkey -a public_key -k private_key 
local address: 0x42F401139048AB106c9e25DCae0Cf4b1Df985c39 
local address base64: QvQBE5BIqxBsniXcrgz0sd+YXDk=
```

##### Updating `truffle.js`
- We have to initialize the `loom-truffle-provider` in it
	- By using `require("loom-truffle-provider")`
- Then we have to let Truffle how to deploy on Loom, we need to add this into the `networks` variable

```javascript
loom_testnet: {
  provider: function() {
    const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'
    const chainId = 'extdev-plasma-us1';
    const writeUrl = 'http://extdev-plasma-us1.dappchains.com:80/rpc';
    const readUrl = 'http://extdev-plasma-us1.dappchains.com:80/query';
    return new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
    },
  network_id: '9545242630824'
}
```

So we have something like
```javascript
// Initialize HDWalletProvider

const HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");
const LoomTruffleProvider = require('loom-truffle-provider');
// Set your own mnemonic here
const mnemonic = "YOUR_MNEMONIC";
// Module exports to make this configuration available to Truffle itself

module.exports = {
// Object with configuration for each network
	networks: {
	// Configuration for mainnet
		mainnet: {
			provider: function () {
			// Setting the provider with the Infura Rinkeby address and Token
			return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
			
			},
			network_id: "1"
		},
		// Configuration for rinkeby network
		rinkeby: {
		// Special function to setup the provider
			provider: function () {
			// Setting the provider with the Infura Rinkeby address and Token
			return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
			
			},
			// Network id is 4 for Rinkeby
			network_id: 4
		},
		
		loom_testnet: {
			provider: function() {
				const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'
				const chainId = 'extdev-plasma-us1';
				const writeUrl = 'http://extdev-plasma-us1.dappchains.com:80/rpc';
				const readUrl = 'http://extdev-plasma-us1.dappchains.com:80/query';
				return new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
			
			},
			
			network_id: '9545242630824'	
		}	
	}
};
```

- Now you deploy using `truffle migrate --network loom_testnet`


#### Deploy to Basechain
1. Create a new private key

```bash
./loom genkey -a mainnet_public_key -k mainnet_private_key 
local address: 0x07419790A773Cc6a2840f1c092240922B61eC778 
local address base64: B0GXkKdzzGooQPHAkiQJIrYex3g=
```

2. Securely pass the private key to truffle 

- Create a gitignore `touch .gitignore`
- Tell github we want to ignore it `echo mainnet_private_key >> .gitignore`

3. Import some libraries and write function read private key

```javascript
const {readFileSync} = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const {join} = require('path');

function getLoomProviderWithPrivateKey(privateKeyPath, chainId, writeURL, readURL){
	const privateKey = readFileSync(privateKeyPath, 'utf-8');
	return new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
}

```

4. Tell Truffle how to deploy to Basechain

```javascript
basechain: { 
	provider: function() { 
	const chainId = 'default'; 
	const writeUrl = 'http://basechain.dappchains.com/rpc'; 
	const readUrl = 'http://basechain.dappchains.com/query'; 
	const privateKeyPath = path.join(__dirname, 'mainnet_private_key'); 
	const loomTruffleProvider = getLoomProviderWithPrivateKey(privateKeyPath, chainId, writeUrl, readUrl); 
	return loomTruffleProvider; 
	}, 
	network_id: '*' 
}
```

5. Whitelist your deployment keys

- Before deploying to Basechain, you need to whitelist your keys by following the instructions from the <a href="https://loomx.io/developers/en/deploy-loom-mainnet.html">Deploy to Mainnet</a> guide
