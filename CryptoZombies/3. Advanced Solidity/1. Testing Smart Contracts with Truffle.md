### Getting started
- The previous lessons have allowed for us to build almost a full game using Solidity and JavaScript
- The file structure should look something like

```
├── build
  ├── contracts
      ├── Migrations.json
      ├── CryptoZombies.json
      ├── erc721.json
      ├── ownable.json
      ├── safemath.json
      ├── zombieattack.json
      ├── zombiefactory.json
      ├── zombiefeeding.json
      ├── zombiehelper.json
      ├── zombieownership.json
├── contracts
  ├── Migrations.sol
  ├── CryptoZombies.sol
  ├── erc721.sol
  ├── ownable.sol
  ├── safemath.sol
  ├── zombieattack.sol
  ├── zombiefactory.sol
  ├── zombiefeeding.sol
  ├── zombiehelper.sol
  ├── zombieownership.sol
├── migrations
└── test
. package-lock.json
. truffle-config.js
. truffle.js
```

- The `test` folder is where tests are going to be put

### Build Artifacts
- Every time a smart contract is compiled, the *Solidity* compilter generates a JSON file (referred to as **build artifacts**) which contains the binary representation of that contract and saves it in the `build/contracts`
- When you run a migration, *Truffle* updates this file with the information related to that network
- The first thing you'll need to do every time you start writing a new test suite is to load the build artifacts of the contract you want to interact with
	- This way, **Truffle** will know how to format our function calls in a way the contract will understand

- Let's say there was a contract called `MyContract` 
- To load the build artifacts, we can do something like

```javascript
const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");
```

- This function returns a contract abstraction
	- Hides the complexity of interacting with **Ethereum** and provides a convenient **JavaScript** interface to our Solidity smart contract

### The `contract()` function
- Behind the scenes, **Truffle** adds a thin wrapper around **Mocha** in order to make testing simpler
- **Mocha** is a feature-rich JS test framework that runs on Node.js and in-browser
	- Makes async testing simple and fun....
	- Runs serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting
	- Maps uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases
- To find out more about mocha go to <a href="https://www.mochajs.org">their website</a>

- Here's what we do need to know how to use
	- group tests by calling a function named `contract()`, it extends to Mocha's `describe()` by providing a list of accounts for testing and doing some cleanup as well
		- `contract()` takes two arguments. The first one, a `string`, must indicate what we're going to test. The second parameter, a `callback` that will be used to write the tests
	- execute them
		- Calling a function called `it()` which takes two arguments
			- A string that describes what the test actually does and a `callback`

- Putting it together

```javascript

const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
	it("should be able to receive Ethers", () => {
		// the test will be written here
		// A well-thought test explains what the code actually does
		// Make sure the description of the test suitea and the test
		// case can be read together as a coherent statment
	});
});
```

### Writing Our First Test
- Before deploying to Ethereum, it is best to test your smart contracts locally
- This can be done by using a tool called <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a>
	- This sets up a local **Ethereum** network
- Every time **Ganache** starfts, it will create 10 test accounts and gives them 100 Ethers to make testing easier
- Since **Ganache** and **Truffle** are tightly integrated we can access these accounts though the `accounts` variable, remember that this is an array
- Good practice is to do the following

```javascript
const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
	let [alice, bob] = accounts; // these is the same as let alice = accounts[0]; let bob = accounts[1]
	it("should be able to receive Ethers", async () => { // we have to make these async so that we can call the function with the await variable		
	});
});

```

- Now every test usually has the following phases
1. **set up**: in which we define the initial state and initialize the inputs.
2. **act**: where we actually test the code. Always make sure we are testing **one** thing
3. **assert**: where we check the results

#### 1. Set up
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.6.0

contract MyContract() {

	Message[] public messages;
	uint lastId = 0; // init this to 0

	struct Message {
		uint256 id;
		string message;
	}

	function addMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
		uint newId = lastId + 1;
		messages.push(Message(newId, newMessage));
		lastId = newId;
	}

	function getMessage(uint256 messageId) public view returns (string){
		var numMessages = messages.length;
		for (uint i = 0; i < numMessages; i++){
			if (messages[i].id == messageId){
				return messages[i];
			}
		}
	}
}
```
- We have mentioned that we initial create a contract abstraction using `artifacts.require()`
- We need to interact with the abstraction by creating a new JavaScript object that acts as our smart contract
- We can do something like 

```javascript
const contractInstance = await MyContract.new();
```

- `.new()` is an asynchronous function since it talks to the blockchain
- Once we create the `contractInstance` we can interact with functions in our smart contract

```Javascript
contractInstance.getMessage();
```

```javascript
const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
	let [alice, bob] = accounts; 
	it("should be able to receive Ethers", async () => { 
		const contractInstance = await MyContract.new();
	});
});

```

#### 2. Act
- How can we make it so the method knows who calls in Smart Contract
- This is problem is solved with the **contract abstraction**
	- One of the features of **Truffle** is that it wraps the original Solidity implementation and lets us specify the address that makes the function call by passing that address as an argument
- Now this allows us to do the following

```javascript
const messageId = 3
const result = await contractInstance.getMessage(messageId, {
	from: alice // remember alice from the `accounts` variable
});
```

##### Logs and Events
- Once we specified the contract we want to test using `artifacts.require`, **Truffle** automatically provides the logs generated by our smart contract
- We can retrieve the variable attributes from generated stucts
- something like `result.logs[0].args.message`
- In a similar fashion, we could use this for other attributes of `stuct`s
- Other than this information, `result` can give us other useful pieces of information about the transaction
	- `result.tx`: the transaction hash
	- `result.receipt`: an object containing the transaction receipt
		- If `result.receipt.status` is equal to `true` it means that the transaction was successful
		- Otherwise the transaction false

#### 3. Assert
- We can use built-in assrtion modules which comes with a set of assertion functions such as `equal()` and `deepEqual()` 
- These functions will result an error if the result is not what is expected
- `assert.equal(firstValue, secondValue)`
	- Returns true if they are the same


```javascript
const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
	let [alice, bob] = accounts; 
	
	it("should be able to add message", async () => { 
		const contractInstance = await MyContract.new();
		const result = await contractInstance.addMessage("My Message", {
			from: alice
		});
		// Checks that the transaction is okay
		assert.equal(result.receipt.status, true);
	});
});

```

### Hooks
- There are times where adding more tests may introduce repetition and redundancy
- We can use the `beforeEach` function to perform some kind of function before each test
- For example, if we wanted to instantiate a new contract everytime a test is being run we could do the following

```javascript
const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
	let [alice, bob] = accounts; 

	// will init a new contract instance before every `it()`
	let contractInstance;
	beforeEach(async () => {
		contractInstance = await MyContract.new();
	})

	it("should be able to add message", async () => { 
		const result = await contractInstance.addMessage("My Message", {
			from: alice
		});
		assert.equal(result.receipt.status, true);
	});
	
	it("should get an empty message", async () => { 
		try {
			const result = await contractInstance.getMessage(1, {
				from: alice
			});
			assert(true); // this gets set to true while the async function is being called
		}
		catch (ex){
			return;
		}
		assert(false, "we should not reach here");
	});
});
```

- On the other hand, if we wanted to `kill` our contracts after we test them to create more space on the blockchain
- Then we have a `selfdestruct` function in `solidity` to help us with this
	- <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#deactivate-and-self-destruct">documentation</a>
- This will remove our contract from the blockchain
```solidity 
function kill() public onlyOwner{
	selfdestruct(owner());
}
```
- Now we can use the `afterEach` function

```javascript
afterEach(async() => {
	await contractInstance.kill(); // kill kill kill
});
```

### Transfers
- Let's say we want to implement some testing logic for transfers
- If we use the *ERC721* token standard then remember we have two ways of doing this

1. 
```solidity
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 tokenId) external payable
```

The first was has **Alice** (the owner) calling `transferFrom` with her `address` as the `_from` parameter, Bob's address as the `_to` parameter and the `tokenId` that needs to be transferred

2. ```

```solidity
function approve (address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable

function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 tokenId) external payable
```

The second way has Alice first calling `approve` with Bob's address and the `tokenId`. Now the contract stores that Bob is approved to get a certain `tokenId`

Now when `transferFrom` is called, it can be either from Alice or Bob (since bob is approved by Alice)

- We can use these as *scenarios* and test them
- We can group these tests together in *contexts*
```javascript
context("single-step transfer scenario", async() => {
	it("should transfer a token to an addredd", async () => {
	
	});
});

context("two-step transfer scenario", async() => {
	it("should approve and transfer token when approvee calls transfer function", async () => {
	
	});
	it("should approve and transfer token when owner calls transfer function", async () => {
		
	});
});
```

- We can also skip tests by adding a `x` in front of `context` and `it`
	- `xcontext` or `xit`

Based on the full zombie contract that can be found [INSERT ZOMBIE CODE HERE]

We can write the following test

```javascript
// test/CryptoZombies.js

const CryptoZombies = artifacts.require("CryptoZombies");
const utils = require("./helpers/utils");
const zombieNames = ["Name1", "Name2"];

contract("CryptoZombies", (accounts) => {
	let [alice, bob] = accounts;
	let contractInstance;
	beforeEach(async() => {
		contractInstance = CryptoZombies.new();
	});

	context("with the single step transfer scenario", async() => {
		it("should transfer a zombie", async() => {
			const result = contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombiesNames[0], {
				from: alice
			});
			const zombieId = result.logs[0].args.zombieId.toNumber(); // parse to number
			await contractInstance.transferFrom(alice, bob, zombieId, {
				from: alice
			});
			const newOwner = await contractInstance.ownerOf(zombieId);
			assert.equal(newOwner, bob); // checks if the new owner is bob
		})
	});

	context("with the two-step transfer scenario", async() => {
		it("should approve and transfer zombie with approvee calling transfer function", async () => {
			const result = contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombiesNames[0], {
				from: alice
			});
			const zombieId = result.logs[0].args.zombieId.toNumber();
			await contractInstance.approve(bob, zombieId, {
				from: alice
			});
			await contractInstance.transferFrom(bob, zombieId, {
				from: bob
			});
			const newOwner = await contractInstance.ownerOf(zombieId);
			assert(newOwner, bob);
		})
		
		it("should approve and transfer zombie with owner calling transfer function", async () => {
			const result = contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombiesNames[0], {
				from: alice
			});
			const zombieId = result.logs[0].args.zombieId.toNumber();
			await contractInstance.approve(bob, zombieId, {
				from: alice
			});
			await contractInstance.transferFrom(bob, zombieId, {
				from: alice
			});
			const newOwner = await contractInstance.ownerOf(zombieId);
			assert(newOwner, bob);
		})
	})

})
```
### Time Travel
- **Ganache** provides a way to move forward in time through two helper function
- `evm_increaseTime` increases the time for the next block
- `evm_mine` mines a new block
	- Interesting
- How do these functions work?
	- Every time a new block gets mined, the miner adds a timestamp to it. Let's say the transactions that created our zombies got mined in block 5
	- Next, we call `evm_increaseTime` but since the blockchain, there is no way of modifying an exisiting block. So when, the contract checks the time, it will not be increased
	- If we run `evm_mine`, block number 6 gets mined and timestamp, which means that when something happens, the smart contract will see that some time has passed

```javascript
await web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({
	jsonrpc: "2.0",
	method: "evm_increaseTime",
	params: [86400], // seconds in a day
	id: new Date().getTime()
});

web3.currentProvider.send({
	jsonrpc: '2.0',
	method: 'evm_mine',
	params: [],
	id: new Date().getTime()
});
```
