### Chainlink Data Feeds
- Suppose we are building a DeFi dapp and want to give users the ability to withdraw ETH worth a certain amout of USD
- To fulfill this request, the smart contract must know how much one Ether is worth
- One way to do this
	- JavaScript application can fetch this information, make requests to the **Binance public API**
	- But a smart contract can't do this directly
- Another way
	- Build a JS application ourselves, but then we are introducing a centralized point of failure!
	- We also couldn't just pull from Binance because again, single point of failure!
- The right way
	- Use a **D**ecentralized **O**racle **N**etwork (DON)
	- Decentralized data sources

### Chain Link
- Chainlink is a frame for DONs and is a way to get data in from multiple sources across multiple oracles
- This DON aggregates data in a decentralized manner and places it on the blockchain in a smart contract ("price reference feed" or "data feed") for us to read from
- All we have to do is read from a contract on the Chainlink network that is constantly being updated
	- News
	- Prices
- Using Chainlink Data Feeds is a way to cheaply, more accurately, and with more security gather data from the real world in this decentralized context
- Since data is coming from multiple sources, multiple people can partake in the ecosystem and it becomes **even cheaper than running a centralized oracle**
- Uses **Off-chain Reporting** to reach consensus on data off-chain and report the data in a cryptographhically proven single transaction back on-chain for users to digest
- Can then make protocols like **Synthetix**, **Aave**, and **Compound**

### Importing from NPM and Github
- We can import code from right outside our contracts
- Often times, we don't need to have every piece of code directly in project
- Can borrow from other application!
- We can either user GitHub or NPM 

https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts

### AggregatorV3Interface
- For example, we can use the on-chain **Feeds Registry** which is an on-chain contract that keeps track of where all of the data feeds are
	- https://docs.chain.link/docs/feed-registry/
- Or we can use a contract address directly to access the feed
	- https://docs.chain.link/docs/reference-contracts/

- Our example involves finding the price of ETH in terms of USD, so we need to find the data feed with this information
- **IMPORTANT:** Each network will have a different address for eatch piece of data we would use. The address of the `ETH/USD` contract will be different on Mainnet Ethereum from Mainnet Polygon, from Rinkby, etc.
- For this example, we will use the Rinkeby test network
	- https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses/#Rinkeby%20Testnet
- Here's how we would start the contract
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.7;

  
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

  
contract PriceConsumerV3 {

	AggregatorV3Interface public priceFeed;

	constructor() public {
		priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x8A753747A1Fa494EC906cE90E9f37563A8AF630e);
	}
}
```

### Working with Tuples
- Now we have to retrieve the latest ETH price by calling the `latestRoundData` function of the `priceFeed` contract
- This function has all the information we are looking for
	- `roundId`: The round ID. Each price update gets a unique round ID
	- `answer`: The current pricer
	- `startedAt`: Timestamp of when the round started
	- `updatedAt`: Timestamp of when the round was updated.
	- `answeredInRound`: The round ID of the round in which the answer was computed

#### Tuples
- A `tuple` is `solidity` is a way to create syntatic grouping of expression
- If a function returns multiple variables, such as the `latestRoundData`, we consider the return type to be a `tuple` of many types

```solidity
function latestRoundData() external view returns (
	uint80 roundId,
	int256 answer,
	uint256 startedAt,
	uint256 updatedAt, 
	uint80 answeredInRound
);
```

- to use this function, we must assign a variable to each of these return values. We can do these in multiple ways
	- Get all of the values back or get a particular value back
```solidity
// saving all return variables
(uint80 roundId, int price, uint startedAt, uint updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData(); 

// saving only the price variable
(,int price,,,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

### Chainlink Data Feeds Decimals
- If we call the previous function to gather the price data for `ETH/USD`
	- Then we would get something like `310523971888`
	- This is supposedly a decimal...
	- At the time of writing this `ETH` is worth `$3,105.52`
- There is a function that can tell us where the decimal points are
- We can write this function
```solidity
// This function will tell us where the decimal places go from `priceFeed.latestRoundData()`
public getDecimals() public view returns (uint8){
	uint8 decimals = priceFeed.decimals();
	return decimals;
}
```





### Chainlink Data Feeds Reference
- Now we can get data from a DON into our created Smart Contract
- To follow along and deploy a Chainlink project, look at the following link
	- https://docs.chain.link/docs/conceptual-overview/
	- The above is also a great resource to refresh some solidity basics
- Often developers choose to work with some of these "out-of-the-box" oracle services since they are much easier and require almost no time to setup
- Once developers are familiar with Chainlink, we can use the following to build sophiosted smart contract application in development suites
	- <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/truffle-starter-kit">Truffle Starter Kit</a>
	- <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit">Hardhat Starter Kit</a>
	- <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-mix">Brownie Starter Kit</a>
- Until then, there are more features to learn about Chainlink
### Chainlink VPF Introduction
- Stands for Chainlink **V**erifiable **R**andomness **F**unction
- It is a way to get randomness from outside the blockchain, but in a proven cryptographic manner
- This is important because for random number generators, we want the logic to be truly incorruptable
- But why not just use a Chainlink data feed to grab a random number?
	- Remember these data are not fully reliable
		- If someone says they are feeding you truly random numbers
			- How do you know they are not lying?
			- If you're building a game, what's to stop them from putting a bias for his profile
			- This service could be hacked
			- You could end up with a corrupt number
- Chainlink VPF includes on-chain verification contracts that cryptogrraphically prove that the random number on the contract is truly random

### Basic Request Model
1. The first step is when a smart contract (called the "callee contract") makes a "request" to a Chainlink node which is comprised of 
	- Smart Contract
	- Corresponding Off-Chain Node
2. When the Chainlink node receives the request, the smart contract emits a specific event that the corresponding Chainlink node is subscribed to/looking for
	- This happens in one transaction
3. Chainlink oracle will then process the request and return the data/computation back to the callee contract, or a contract that will in turn send the response to the callee contract
	- The middle contract is often referred to as the *oracle contract*
	- This return process happens in a second **seperate** transaction so in total the basic 
	- request model is a two transaction event, and will take at least two blocks to complete
	- This is hard to hack because of the minimum number of transactions being two, allows for brute force attacks to be extremely expensive

- Now, similar to when we make a transaction on Ethereum or any Solidity compatible blockchain
	- Transaction gas is required
- To work with oracle
	- We need some oracle gas, also known as the <a href="https://chain.link/">Link or Chainlink token</a>
- The Link token is specifically designed to work with oracles and ensure the security of the Chainlink oracle networks
- When we make a request using Basic Request Model, our contracts must be funded with a set amount of LINK
	- As defined by the specific oracle service that we ae using

#### Why didn't we do this with Data Feeds?
- With data feeds, an entrie group of Chainlink nodes are being requested for data instead of just one Chainlink node
- However, only one entity has to kick off the request to the whole network
- So we were able to benefit because someone else already created the requests to the oracles for the different kinds of data described in the data feeeds
- These data feeds are sponsored by a group of projects all making use of data feeds such as 
	- <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>
	- <a href="https://compound.finance/">Compund</a>
	- <a href="https://synthetix.io/">Synthetix</a>
- Updates to the network are being kicked off programmatically whenever there is a slightprice change in the data they are reporting
	- Working together as a group we can keep the transaction costs down and create this collective good the whole ecosystem can benefit from!
- In summary, someone else followed a bit more advanced version of the basic request model for us with the data feeds!

### Chainlink VRF Under the Hood
- The Chainlink VRF follows this basic request model with one added benefit
	- Since there is a cryptographic proof on-chain of the randomnewss of the numberf from a Chainlink VRF node, we are safe to work with a single Chainlink VRF node!
- In brief, a smart contract request randomness by specifying a hash used to uniquely identify a Chainlink oracle
- That hash, combined with the Chainlink's secret key will generate a random number which will then be returned to the contract on-chain 
- `VRF Coordinate` an on-chaion contract takes the random number along with the proof and is verified uysing the oracle's public key
	- This relys of public key signatures and proof verifictions
	- <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.6/VRFCoordinator.sol">Functions that the `VRF Coordinate` uses</a>

#### Constructor in a contructor (constructor-ception)
- In order to interact with a Chainlink node, we need to know a few variables
1. The **address** of the **Chainlink token contract**. 
	- This is needed so our contract can tell if we have enough `LINK` tokens to pay for gas
2. The **VRF coordinator contract address**
	- Needed to verify that the number we get is actually random
3. **Chainlink node keyhash**
	- Used to identify which Chainlink node we want to work with
4. The **Chainlink node fee**
	- Represents the fee (gas) the Chainlink will charge us, expressed in `LINK` tokens
- These variables and their values can all be be found <a href="https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf/v2/supported-networks/">here</a>
	- This is also a great resources to find some test networks to work on!

Now let's look at this code 

```solidity
import "./Y.sol"

contract X is Y {
	constructor() Y() public {
		// constructor code for `Y`
	}
}
```

- This a valid to set up the constructor of the imported contract
	- We have to make sure to declare the name of the contract we want to init

This is also legal with our `VRFConsumerbase` contract
```solidity

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

contract SomeContract {

	constructor() VRFConsumerBase(
		0xb3dCcb4Cf7a26f6cf6B120Cf5A73875B7BBc655B, // VRF Coordinator
		0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709 // LINK Token
	) public {
	
	}
	
}
```

### Defining Chainlink VRF variables
- Now we just need to define
	- `keyhash`
	- `fee`
- We can also make a global variable called `randomResult`
	- That will store the most recent return of a Chainlink VRF
	- Can be found in the <a href="https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf/v2/supported-networks/">documentation</a>
```
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

contract RandomContract {

	bytes32 public keyHash;	
	uint256 public fee;
	uint256 public randomResult;

	constructor() VRFConsumerBase(
		0xb3dCcb4Cf7a26f6cf6B120Cf5A73875B7BBc655B, // VRF Coordinator
		0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709 // LINK Token
	) public {
		keyHash = 0x2ed0feb3e7fd2022120aa84fab1945545a9f2ffc9076fd6156fa96eaff4c1311;
		fee = 100000000000000000;
	}
	
}
```

### The `requestRandomness` and `fulfillRandomness` functions

Remember, the Chainlink VRF follows the basic request model, so we need to define:
	1.  A function to request the random number	
	2.  A function for the the Chainlink node to return the random number to.

Remember, the Chainlink node is actually going to call the VRF Coordinator first to verify the number is random, then the VRF Coordinator will be the one to call our `RandomContract` contract.

Since we are importing the `VRFConsumerbase` contract, we can use the two built in functions that do both of these!

A. `requestRandomness`

1.  This function checks to see that our contract has `LINK` tokens to pay a Chainlink node
2.  Then, it sends some `LINK` tokens to the Chainlink node
3.  Emits an event that the Chainlink node is looking for
4.  Assigns a `requestId` to our request for a random number on-chain

B. `fulfillRandomness`

1.  The Chainlink node first calls a function on the VRF Coordinator and includes a random number
2.  The VRF Coordinator checks to see if the number is random
3.  Then, it returns the random number the Chainlink node created, along with the original requestID from our request

Seeing it in action

```solidity
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

contract RandomContract is VRFConsumerBase {

	bytes32 public keyHash;	
	uint256 public fee;
	uint256 public randomResult;

	constructor() VRFConsumerBase(
		0xb3dCcb4Cf7a26f6cf6B120Cf5A73875B7BBc655B, // VRF Coordinator
		0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709 // LINK Token
	) public {
		keyHash = 0x2ed0feb3e7fd2022120aa84fab1945545a9f2ffc9076fd6156fa96eaff4c1311;
		fee = 100000000000000000;
	}
	
	function getRandomNumber() public returns (bytes32){	
		return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);
	}
	// We have to use the override keyword here because VRF Coordinator uses this function
	function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override{
	randomResult = randomnewss;
	}	
}
```
