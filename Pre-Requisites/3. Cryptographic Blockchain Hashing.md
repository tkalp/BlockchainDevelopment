## What is hashing?
- Hashing or hash is a term that is commonly used in blockchain technology
- Refers to the transformation and generation of input data of any length into a string of a fixed size
	- A specific algorithm is used to perform this
	- For example, the Bitcoin hashing algorithm is SHA-256
- It is a one-way street for hashing (one-way cryptographic function)
	- That is, you can generate a hash output (referred to as a digest) from an input and a hashing algorithm
	- But you cannot generate the input from a digest and a hashing algorithm

### Why do we need hashing in blockchain?
- Useful to prevent fraudulent transactions
- Double spending in blockchain is also preventing
- Storing password is great as well when we use hashes
	- If an attacker steals your password file, they may only have the hash

When it comes to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, how does it play a factor?
- It is a unique number that is not duplicable according to the SHA256 algorithm
	- The notion of hash collisions
- Because it is unique, it is frequently used to verify a file's authenticity
	- When there's a change in a hashed file, its hash will drastically change as well, not just by one or two characters
	- With SHA256
		- `teddy` hashes to `2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824`
		- `tedd` hashes to `c97bbf9039194863b01939bc6a3b1e721521571777d41e5a2f797d5c7f7cd78f`
		- <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html">Try it out yourself</a>
	- An important notion of blockchain is that fact that each subsequent hash is tied to the previous hash, thus ensuring the consistency of all blocks

### How does hashing work in Blockchain
- A hashing algorithm works by being able take in an infinite number of bits and producing an output that is a **fixed** number of bits
	- For SHA256, can you guess how many bits the output always is?
- This is regardless of the length of the input data
	- Any input will produce a fixed-bit length **hash** or **digest**

- So before we continue going on about hashes, we have to do a little bit of background into data structures
	- I know....the absolute worst!
- A data structure is nothing more than a specified way of storing data
- When it comes to blockchain, we like to use two specific key elements
	- **Pointers**
		- Variables that refer to other variables
		- They act as indicators that show the way to the right location
		- For example, in lower level languages such as C/C++ we can use pointer variables to store memorh addresses of the variables we actually want to access
	- **Linked Lists**
		- Make up a sequence of nodes that are connected with the help of these pointers
- By the power of hashing we can now assign each block an original identifier that will introduce the irreversable consequence of changing the blockchain

- Now each block is identified by information included in the header of the block which include details such as 
	- The version number of the blockchain
	- UNIX Timestamp
	- Hash Pointers
	- Nonce
		- This is the whole reason that crypto mining exists
	- a hash of a Merkle root
		- Don't worry we'll talk about this a little later

### How to solve a hash? (Crypto Mining)
- With all blockchains comes the powerful notion of crypto mining which is simply the following
	- Remember that nonce we mentioned earlier?
		- Well the goal of a miner is to solve what that nonce is supposed to be
	- So how does the miner know what the nonce is going to be?
		- Each block will have a target hash that the miner will need to produce a hash less than or equal to the target hash?
	- Okay so what do we actually hash?
		- The miner will need to have the following to generate a new block
			- Previous block hash value
			- Content of data block
			- Nonce
				- This is what we need to find
		- The miner will hash all of these together to find a value that is less than the target value. 
	- This target ends up being monumentally expensive because as time goes on, the target value becomes less and less
		- As of 2022, there are 19 million bitcoin tokens currently in existence
			- Leaving only 2 million tokens to be mined
- This idea of finding a hash that is less than a target is specific to Bitcoin as other blockchains have different patterns that they must adhere for the block to be published to the blockchain
- Bitcoin uses PoW while Ethereum recently switched to PoS (Proof of Stake)
