### Let's talk about PoW for a quick second
#### Story Time!!!
- PoW was technically founded in 1993 as a use case to deter DoS attacks
	- Article discusses the potential of the algorithm to prevent fraud and its sustainability in the long-term
- Hal Finney published an article in 2004 for another system called the Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW)
	- System worked by receiving a non-exchangable or non-fungible hashcash based proof of work token
	- In return, created an RSA-signed token that could be transferred from person-to-person
- Adam Back's Hackcash
	- Requires senders to perform small amount of computing before sending an email
	- Receivers can mitigate span

### Present Day PoW
- Now the PoW Algorithm
	- Oldest consensus mechanism and the most popular algorithm
	- Consensus algorithm used for preventing the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp">51% attack</a> or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,t%20adequately%20protected%20and%20secured.">double spends</a>
	- Used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to confirm transactions and produce new blocks added to the chain
	- With PoW, miners compete to complete transactions on the network in exchange for a reward for their speed and accuracy
- Correlated to the blockchain hash as this algorithm is useful to confirm transactions and produce new blocks to the chain

#### How is PoW applied on Blockchain?
- Has many reasons that it is so popular
	- Primary rationale for its reputation is its capability to promote honestly in the decentralized ecosystem
- PoW is also sustainable to attain the Byzantine Fault Tolenrence (BFT) objective
	- System that is capable of withstanding failures associates with the Byzantine Generals' problem
	- Means that a network can avoid situations where some nodes or miners attempt to act against the consensus
		- Attempt to publish an incorrect block
	- With the help of BFT characteristics, the PoW algorithm works in such a way that the nodes validate a block within a netowkr by solving a complex mathematical problem
- PoW consenses creates a relatively healthy and transparent closed economy
	- Encourages some users to continue to sustain the blockchain ecosystem

#### Breaking down PoW
- Once again, PoW employs a model where nodes solve a mathematical puzzle to produce the next block added to the network
	- If anything, remember that!!!!!!!
- Block Leaders
	- Produce the next block
	- Selected in lottery-like format that corresponds directly to their contributed computing power to the process
- There are two primary participants in the PoW consens model
	- Miners
	- Full Node Operators
