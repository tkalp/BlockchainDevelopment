## What is a digital signature?
- Public key primitives of message authentication
- A perfect and common example in the real world is to use handwritten signatures on handwritten or typed messages
- This is is used to bind the signatory to the message
- Similarly, a digital signature is used to bind a person or an entity to the digital data that they wish to sign
	- This signature can be verified by the receiver of the content or a third party
	- This is the notion of using public key cryptography
	- The signature is calculated from the data and a the signer's private key
		- This key is only known to the signer
	- The receiver of the message needs to assure that the message belongs to the sender and that they should not be able to repudiate the origin of that message
		- Sender cannot claim that it was not them who sent the message
		- Extremely crutial in business applications in case there is a dispute over exchanged data between parties


### Model of Digital Signatures
- There are two parties, Alice and Bob
	- Both have their own public-private key pair
	- These are different keys than used for encryption/decryption
	- The private key used for signing is the **signature key**
	- The public key used for verification is the **verification key**

1. Alice feeds data to the hash function generates hash of data
2. Hash Value and Signature Key (private key) are then fed into the signature algorithm with produces the digital signature on given hash
	- The signature is then appended to the the data and both are sent to the verifier
	- Similar to how you sign the bottom of a letter to show that its a genuine artifact
3. Alice send data and signature to Bob
3. Bob feeds the digital signature and the verification key (public key) into the verification algorithm
	- The verification algorithm will produce the the hash output of the original data/message
4. Bob also feeds the data into the hashing function used originally to compare against
5. If the values are equal, then Bob has now successfully verified Alice's data and the origin of the data
	- This is due to the only Alice being able to sign this message with her private key
	- This message can only be decrypted using her public key
	- The comparison of hashes will prove the integrity

- Some important notes about this model
	- Hashing is important for efficiency of the entire scheme, rather than signing the data directly
	- For example with RSA, the encryption/signing process using RSA involves modular exponentiation
		- Signing data through modular exponentiation is computationally expensive and time consuming
		- Signing a hash is cheaper and more efficient than signing a large piece of data
	- Various types of signing algorithms
		- RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)
		- HS2565 (HMAC with SHA-256)

### Important of Digital Signature
- **Message Authentication**
	- When Bob validated Alice's digital signature, he is assured that the signature could only have been created by Alice's private key, since Bob used her public key to verify
- **Data Integrity**
	- If an attacker attempts to modify the data, then the verification process will fail due to the hashes not matching. This can happen if an attacker modifies the the digital signature or the original content. Unless the attacker figures out the private key of the sender, which is extremely difficult to computate
- **Non-repudiation**
	- Alice cannot take back that she sent a specific message to Bob due to her signing a message with her private key. Bob can use the digital signature to proof that Alice had signed a message using her private key.

### Encryption with Digital Signature
- We can also use digital signatures to encrypt and decrypt messages between Alice and Bob
- This is normal to use the encrypt-then-sign standard of encryption

1. Alice encrypts data using Bob's public key to generate **encrypted data**
2. Alice inputs ciphertext into hash function to product hash
3. Alice signs the hash of the ciphertext with her private key
4. Alice then sends digital signature and ciphertext to Bob
5. Bob can then decrypt the ciphertext with his private key and produce hash A
6. Bob can also verify the signature using Alice's public key to produce hash B
7. Bob can now verify that if hash A = hash B, then the message came from Alice (message integrity) and they have achieved confidentiality in the process
