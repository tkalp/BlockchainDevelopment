### Addresses
- The ethereum blockchain is made up of `accounts`, think of them like bank accounts
- Each account has a balance of `Ether` and can be used to send and receive Ether payments to other accounts
	- Just like each bank account can wire transfer money to other bank accounts
- Each account has an `address`
	- Think about it like a bank account number
	- Unique identifier that points to that account
	- `0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268`
	- Each of these addresses is used by a seperate person
	- So we can think of this as a unique id that represents ownership


### Mappings
- `mapping` is another way of storing organized data in Solidity
- Define a `mapping` this way

```solidity
// storing an uint that holds owners bank account value
mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;
// used to store a string
mapping (uint => string) userIdToName;
```

- It is essentially a key-valye store for storing and looking up data in `O(1)` time







### Msg.sender
- There are certain global variables in Solidity that are available to all functions
- One of these is `msg.sender`
	- This refers to the address of the person who called the current contract
- **Note:** In `solidity`, function execution always needs to start with an external caller. So there will always be a `msg.sender`
- Example


```solidity
mapping (address => uint) favNumbers;

function setMyNumber(uint number) public {
	// Whoever calls this function can set this number
	favNumbers[msg.sender] = number;
}

function getMyNumber() public view returns (uint){
	// gets the senders fav number
	// returns 0 if not found in mapping
	return favNumbers[msg.sender];
}
```




### Require
`require` makes it so that the function will throw an error and stop executing if some condition is not met

```solidity
function getIntoBar(uint _age, string memory _name) public returns (string memory){
	// We compare the age that this function is being called with
	require(_age >= 18 && _name != "Chad");
	// If it passes the condition, we get the drinks
	return "SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS!!!!"
}
```

- We will learn further on that we can use functions like this as `modifiers`


### Inheritance
- One feature of `solidity` when managing long code is something called **inheritance**
- Now this is similar to other languages such as Java, C#, Python
- The syntax is as follows


```solidity
contract CasinoGame {
	address public winner;
	uint public gameId;

	function getWinner(address memory _winner) view public returns (address memory){
		return _winner;
	}
}

contract BlackJack is CasinoGame {

	function DealBJ() view public returns (string memory){
		return "BLACKJACK!"
	}
}
```
