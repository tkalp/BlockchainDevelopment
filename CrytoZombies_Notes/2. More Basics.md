### Addresses
- The ethereum blockchain is made up of `accounts`, think of them like bank accounts
- Each account has a balance of `Ether` and can be used to send and receive Ether payments to other accounts
	- Just like each bank account can wire transfer money to other bank accounts
- Each account has an `address`
	- Think about it like a bank account number
	- Unique identifier that points to that account
	- `0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268`
	- Each of these addresses is used by a seperate person
	- So we can think of this as a unique id
