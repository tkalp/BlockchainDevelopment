### ERC20 tokens
- A **token** on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract thats following some common rules
- Namely it implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share such as
	- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)`
	- `balanceOf(address _owner)`
- Internally the smart contract usually has a mapping,Â `mapping(address => uint256) balances`, that keeps track of how much balance each address has.
- So basically a token is just a contract that keeps track of who owns how much of that token, and some functions so those users can transfer their tokens to other addresses.
- Since all ERC20 tokens share the same set of functions with the same names, they can all be interacted with in the same ways.
- This means if you build an application that is capable of interacting with one ERC20 token, it's also capable of interacting with any ERC20 token.
- One example of this would be an exchange. 
	- When an exchange adds a new ERC20 token, really it just needs to add another smart contract it talks to. 
	- Users can tell that contract to send tokens to the exchange's wallet address, and the exchange can tell the contract to send the tokens back out to users when they request a withdraw.

### ERC721 Tokens
- Not interchangeable since each one is assumed to be unique and are not divisible
- These are used for collectables
- Note that using a standard like ERC721 has the benefit that we don't have to implement the auction or escrow logic within our contract that determines how players can trade / sell our collectables. 
	- If we conform to the spec, someone else could build an exchange platform for crypto-tradable ERC721 assets, and our ERC721 assets would be usable on that platform. So there are clear benefits to using a token standard instead of rolling your own trading logic.


### ERC721 Standard
The following is the ERC71 standard

```solidity
contract ERC721 { 
	event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId); 
	event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId); 
	function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);
	function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
	function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
	function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable; 
}
```

#### Implementing a token contract
- When implementing a token contract, the first thing we have to do is copy the interface to its own Solidity file and import it
- `import "./erc721.sol"`
- Then our contract that contains the colectables inherits from it
- We then would have to use the functions that are defined in the interface in the collectable contract

#### `balanceOf`
- This function simply takes an address and returns how many tokens that address owns

#### `ownerOf`
- This function takens a token ID and returns the `address` of the person who owns it

#### Transfer logic
- There are 2 different ways to transfer tokens

```solidity
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
```

and

```solidity
function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
```

1. The first way is the token's owner calls `transerFrom` with their `address` as the `_from` parameter, the `address` they wants to transer as the `_to` parameter, and the token `_tokenId` of the token they want to transfer
2. The second way is the token's owner first calls `approve` with the address he wants to transfer to, and the `_tokenID`. The contract then stores who is approved to take a token, usually a `mapping(uint => address)`. Then, when the owner or the approved address calls `transferFrom`, the contract checks if that `msg.sender` is the owner or is approved by the owner to take the token, and if so it transfers the token to him.

- Both methods contain the same transfer transer logic.
	- In one case the send of the token calls the `transferFrom` function, in the other, the owner of the approvded receiver of the token calls it

### Preventing Overflows
- One major security feature that all developers should be aware of when writing smart contracts
	- Preventing overflows and undeflows
- Overflow

```solidity
uint8 number = 255; // the highest this type can get to
number++; // this will cause an overflow and consequenctly turn number = 0
```

- To prevent stuff like this we can use the `SafeMath` library
- A library is a special type of contract in Solidity
	- One of the things is it useful for is to attach functions to native data types

```solidity
using SafeMath for uint256;

uint256 a = 5;
uint256 b = a.add(3)
uint256 c = a.mul(2)
```

- If an overflow were to occur, then the library would throw an error
- Here's an example from the `add` function

```solidity
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
	uint256 c = a + b; 
	assert(c >= a); // This checks that the sum is greater or equal to the original number. If it's good, it'll return `c`, if not it will throw an error
	return c; 
}
```

- We can modify this contract for any type of `uint`
- OpenZepplin is a great resource!


### Comments
- Similar to JavaScript but there is certain syntax to them
- Example
```solidity
contract CryptoZombies { 
	/* This is a multi-lined comment. I'd like to thank all of you who have taken
	your time to try this programming course. I know it's free to all of you, and
	it will stay free forever, but we still put our heart and soul into making this
	as good as it can be. Know that this is still the beginning of Blockchain
	development. We've come very far but there are so many ways to make this
	community better. If we made a mistake somewhere, you can help us out and open
	a pull request here: https://github.com/loomnetwork/cryptozombie-lessons Or if
	you have some ideas, comments, or just want to say hi - drop by our Telegram
	community at https://t.me/loomnetworkdev */ 
}
```

- The format we want to use is `natspec` which looks like
```solidity
/// @title A contract for basic math operations 
/// @author H4XF13LD MORRIS ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ 
/// @notice For now, this contract just adds a multiply function 
contract Math { 
	/// @notice Multiplies 2 numbers together 
	/// @param x the first uint. 
	/// @param y the second uint. 
	/// @return z the product of (x * y) 
	/// @dev This function does not currently check for overflows 
	function multiply(uint x, uint y) returns (uint z) { 
		// This is just a normal comment, and won't get picked up by natspec 
		z = x * y; 
	} 
}
```

- Here's what the above means
- `@title` and `@author` are straightforward
- `@notice` explains to a **user** what the contract/function does 
- `@dev` is for explaining extra details to developers
- `@param` and `@return` are for describing what each parameter and return value of a function are for
