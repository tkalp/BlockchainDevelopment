### Addresses
- The ethereum blockchain is made up of `accounts`, think of them like bank accounts
- Each account has a balance of `Ether` and can be used to send and receive Ether payments to other accounts
	- Just like each bank account can wire transfer money to other bank accounts
- Each account has an `address`
	- Think about it like a bank account number
	- Unique identifier that points to that account
	- `0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268`
	- Each of these addresses is used by a seperate person
	- So we can think of this as a unique id that represents ownership


### Mappings
- `mapping` is another way of storing organized data in Solidity
- Define a `mapping` this way

```solidity
// storing an uint that holds owners bank account value
mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;
// used to store a string
mapping (uint => string) userIdToName;
```

- It is essentially a key-valye store for storing and looking up data in `O(1)` time

### Msg.sender
- There are certain global variables in Solidity that are available to all functions
- One of these is `msg.sender`
	- This refers to the address of the person who called the current contract
- **Note:** In `solidity`, function execution always needs to start with an external caller. So there will always be a `msg.sender`
- Example


```solidity
mapping (address => uint) favNumbers;

function setMyNumber(uint number) public {
	// Whoever calls this function can set this number
	favNumbers[msg.sender] = number;
}

function getMyNumber() public view returns (uint){
	// gets the senders fav number
	// returns 0 if not found in mapping
	return favNumbers[msg.sender];
}
```




### Require
`require` makes it so that the function will throw an error and stop executing if some condition is not met

```solidity
function getIntoBar(uint _age, string memory _name) public returns (string memory){
	// We compare the age that this function is being called with
	require(_age >= 18 && _name != "Chad");
	// If it passes the condition, we get the drinks
	return "SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS!!!!"
}
```

- We will learn further on that we can use functions like this as `modifiers`


### Inheritance
- One feature of `solidity` when managing long code is something called **inheritance**
- Now this is similar to other languages such as Java, C#, Python
- The syntax is as follows


```solidity
contract CasinoGame {
	address public winner;
	uint public gameId;

	function getWinner(address memory _winner) view public returns (address memory){
		return _winner;
	}
}

contract BlackJack is CasinoGame {
	function DealBJ() view public returns (string memory){
		return "BLACKJACK!"
	}
}
```
### Import
- We can clean up the code even further by placing contracts in seperate files and calling them using `import` statements
- Example

```solidity
import "./somecontract.sol";

contract newContract is SomeContract{
	// rest of contract here
}
```
### Storage vs Memory (Data Location)
- There are 2 location you can store variables in `solidity`
	- `memory`
	- `storage`
- **Storage** refers to variables stored permanently on the blockchain
- **Memory** refers to temporary variables and are erased between external function calls to your contract
	- Compare it to computer's hard disk vs RAM
- `solidity` will handle these declarations by default
	- State variables (variables declared outside of functions) will be by default declared as `storage` variables
	- Variables declared inside functions are `memory` and will dissapear when the function call ends

- Example

```solidity
contract BikeFactory{
	struct Bike {
		string color; 
		string brand;
		uint value;
		string status;
	}

	Bike[] bikes;

	function buyBike(uint _index) public {
		Bike bike = bikes[_index];
		// This should work but the compiler will yell at you and say that
		// you should declare bike as a `storage` or `memory` variable

		// Declaring as a `storage` variable
		Bike storage bike = bikes[_index];
		bike.status = "bought";
		// this will permantly change the status of bikes[_index] on the blockchain

		// Declaring as a `memory` variable
		Bike memory bikeNumeroDos = bikes[_index + 1];
		bikeNumeroDos.status = "sold";
		// this will modify a `copy` of the bike found in bikes[_index + 1]

		bikes[_index+1] = bikeNumeroDos;
		// you can store back in storage this way
	}
}
```

### More on Function Visibility (Internal & External)
- In addition to `private` and `public`
- There is also `internal` and `external`
- `internal` is the same as `private`, except that it's also accessible to contracts that inherit from this contract
- `external` is similar to `public` except that these functions can ONLY be called outside the contract
	- They can't be called by other functions inside that contract


```solidity
contract Sandwich{
	uint private sandwichesEaten = 0;

	function eat() internal {
		sandwichesEaten++;
	}
}

contract BLT is Sandwich {
	uint private baconSandwichesEaten = 0;

	function eatWithBacon() public returns (string memory){
		baconSandwichesEaten++;
		// this can be called because it is an internal function
		eat();
	}
}
```

### Interacting with other contracts
- For contracts to talk to other contracts on the blockchain that we don't own, we need to define an **interface**
- Example
```solidity
contract LuckyNumber {
	mapping (address => uint) numbers;

	function setNum(uint _num) public {
		numbers[msg.sender] = _num;
	}

	function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint){
		return numbers[_myAddress];
	}
}
```

- This an example contract of someone being able to look up anyone's lucky number that they have set using this
- Now let's lets say we wanted to use this in an external contract
- Well now we have to define an interface

```solidity
contract NumberInterface{
	function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint);
}
```
- This looks like a regular ol' contract
- But there are some differences
1. Only declaring functions we want to interact with
2. No definition of function body, we simply end the function with a `;`

- This way, the compiler knows that this is an interface

### Using an interface
- Once the interface is defined, we can use it as the following

```solidity
contract MyContract {
	address NumberInterfaceAddress = 0xabc123...
	// the address of the contract on the blockchain
	NumberInterface numberContract = NumberInterface(NumberInterfaceAddress);
	// this `numberContract` is pointing to the external contract
	function getFavNumberOfAddress(address _owner) public view returns (uint){
		return numberContract.getNum(_owner);
	}
}
```

- This way, your contract can interact with any other contract on the blockchain, as long as those functions are exposed using `public` or `external`


### Handling Multiple Return Values
- The following can be used to handle multiple return values
```solidity
function multipleReturns() internal returns (uint, uint, string memory){
	return (1, 2, "Buzz");
}

function processMultipleReturns() external {
	uint a;
	uint b;
	string memory c;
	(a,b,c) = multipleReturns();
}

function getLastReturnValue() external {
	string memory c;
	(,,c) = multipleReturns();
}
```
