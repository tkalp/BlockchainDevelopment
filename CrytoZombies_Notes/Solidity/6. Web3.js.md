### What is Web3.js?
- Remember that the Ethereum network is made up of nodes, with each containing a copy of the blockchain
- When you want to call a funciton on a smart contract, you need to query one of these nodes and tell it 

1. The address of the smart contract
2. The function you want to call
3. The variables you want to pass to that function

- Ethereum nodes only speak a language called **JSON-RPC**
	- Not very human-readable
- Example of sending a `JSON-RPC` request to a node 

```json
// Yeah... Good luck writing all your function calls this way!
// Scroll right ==>
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendTransaction","params":[{"from":"0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155","to":"0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567","gas":"0x76c0","gasPrice":"0x9184e72a000","value":"0x9184e72a","data":"0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675"}],"id":1}

```

- SO luckily Web3.js hides these queries below the surfave and developers can interact with a much more readable interface

```javascript
CryptoZombies.methods.createRandomZombie("Vitalik Nakamoto ðŸ¤”") .send({ from: "0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155", gas: "3000000" })
```

### Getting started with Web3.js
- Depending on the project workflow, we can use the following

```
// Using NPM 
npm install web3 
// Using Yarn 
yarn add web3 
// Using Bower bower 
install web3 // ...etc.
```

- Or we can just download the minified
- .js file and include it in the project

### Web3 Providers
- First thing we need is a Web3 Provider
- Ethereum is made up of nodes that all share a copy of the same data
- Setting a Web3 Provider in Web3.js tells our code **which node** we should be talking to handle our reads and writes
	- Kind of like setting the URL of the remote web server for API calls in a traditional web application
- You could host your own node
- But there is a third-party service that makes your life easier so you don't need to maintain your own Ethereum node is order to provide a DApp for your users
- WELCOME **Infura**

### Infura
- Service that maintains a set of Ethereum nodes with a caching layer for fast reads
	- Can access for free through API
- Using Infura as a provider, you can reliably send and receive messages to/from the Ethereum blockchain without needing to set up and maintain our own node
- Can set up Web3 to use Infura as a Web3 provider as follows
```javascript
var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider("wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws"));
```

- However, for applications that require lots of WRITES and users signing transactions with their private key, we will need to use a different service provider


### Metamask
- Browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that lets users securely manage their Ethereum accounts and private keys
	- Use these accounts to interact with websites that are using Web3.js
- Using Metamask's web3 provider
	- Metamask injects their web3 providers into the browser in the flobal JavaScript object web3
	- App can check to see if `web3` exists, and if it does 
		- set `web3.currentProvider` as the provider

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', function() { 
// Checking if Web3 has been injected by the browser (Mist/MetaMask) 
	if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') { 
		// Use Mist/MetaMask's provider 
		web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider); 
	} 
	else { 
	// Handle the case where the user doesn't have web3. Probably 
	// show them a message telling them to install Metamask in 
	// order to use our app. 
	} 
	// Now you can start your app & access web3js freely: 
	startApp();
});
```

- You can use this boilerplate code in all the apps that are created in order to require users to have Metamask to use your DApp

### Talking to Contracts
- Web3.js will need 2 things to talk to your contract
	1. **Contract Address**
	2. **ABI**

#### Contract Address
- After the smart contract is writte, it will be complied and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain
- After contract is deployed, it gets a fixed address on the blockchain where it will live FOREVER
- For example, the CryptoKitties contract lives on `0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d`

#### Contract ABI
- Stands for Application Binary Interface
- Representation of contracts' methods in JSON format that tells Web3.js how to format function calls in a way your contract will understand
- When you compile contract to deploy to Ethereum, the compiler will give you the ABI, you will need to copy and save this in addition to the contract address

#### Instantiating a Web3.js Contract

```javascript
// Instantiate myContract 
var myContract = new web3js.eth.Contract(myABI, myContractAddress);
```

### Calling Contract Functions
- Web3.js has two methods that will be used to call functions on contracts
	- `call`
	- `send`

#### `call`
- Used for `view` and `pure` functions
- Only runs on the local node
- Won't create a transaction on the blockchain
- `view` and `pure` functions are read-only and don't change state on the blockchain. They also don't cost any gas, and the user won't be prompted to sign a transaction with MetaMask

```javascript
myContract.methods.myMethod(123).call();
```

#### `send`
- Will create a transaction and change data on the blockchain
- You'll need to use `send` for any functions that aren't `view` or `pure`
- Note `send`ing a transaction will require the user to pay gas and will pop up their Metamask to prompt them to sign a transaction
- When we use Metamask as our web3 provider, this all happens automatically when we call `send()` and we don't need to do anything special in the code

```javascript
myContract.methods.myMethod(123).send();
```

### Getting data from Contract using `call`
```solidity
contract InboxContract {

	struct Message {
		uint id;
		string message;
		address from;
		uint sendTime;
	}

	Message[] public messages;
}
```

- In Solidity, when a function is declared `public`, it automatically creates a public `getter`
- So if we want to look up the message with id 100 we can easily use the following

```javascript
function getMessageDetails(id){
	return inboxContract.methods.messages(id).call();
}

getMessageDetails(100)
.then(function(result){
	console.log("Message 100: ", JSON.stringify(result));
})
```

- The result would look something like this

```json
{
	"message" : "some mail message",
	"from" : "0x90123..."
	"sendTime" : "234492910103" // or some UNIX time
}
```

### Getting the user's account in MetaMask
- MetaMask allows the user to manage multiple accounts in their extension
- To view which account is currently active, we can use the following line

```javascript
var userAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];
```

- Because the user can switch the account at anytime during Metamask, our application needs to constantly monior which account is currently active

```javascript
var accountInterval = setInterval(function () {
	// Check if the account has changed
	if (web3.eth.accounts[0] !== userAccount){
		userAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];
		// Call some function to update the UI with the new account
		updateInterface();
	}
}, 100)
```

- The above function checks the current active account every 100 ms to see if it is different than the account that is currently being used
	- The update function would mostly just be focused on the UI, nothing in the back would need to be updated
	- This could be done in whichever framework we so desired

### Sending Transactions using `send`
- There are a few major differences from `call` functions

1. `send`ing a transaction requires a `from` address of who's calling the function. We'll want to this to be the use of our DApp, so MetaMask will pop up to prompt them to sign the transaction
2. `send`ing a transaction costs gas
3. There will be a significant dely from when the user `send`s a transaction and when that transaction actually takes effect on the blockchain
	- This is because we have to wait for the transaction be included in a block
	- The block time for Ethereum is on average 15 seconds
	- If there are a lot of pending transactions on Ethereum or if the user sends too low of a gas price, our transaction may have to wait several blocks to get included. 
	- This could take some time

For example if we have the following code

```soldiity
contract CarFactory {

	struct Car {
		string brand;
		string make;
		uint8 year;
	}

	Car [] public cars;

	function makeCar(string memory _brand, string memory _make, uint _year) public {
		cars.push(Car(_brand, _make, _year));	
	}
}
```

- This is a simple contract that has one function push cars into the storage array of cars
	- Reminder that `storage` stores variables directly on blockchain and any interaction with them will cost some gas

- Now how we would call this function in `javascript`

```javascript
function createCar(brand, make, year){
	// Update the UI to notify the user that this may take a while
	$('#status').text('Please wait while car is being created');

	return carFactory.methods.makeCar(brand, make, year)
	.send({from: userAccount})
	.on("receipt", function (receipt){
		$('#status').text(`Successfully created the ${year} ${brand} ${make} car`)
	})
	.on("error", function(error){
		$('#status').text(error);
	})
}
```

- The function `send`s a transaction our Web3 provider and chains some event listeners
	- `receipt` will fire when the transaction is included into a block on Ethereum, which means our Car has been created and saved on the contract
	- `error` will fire if there's an issue that prevented the transaction from being included in a block, such as the user not sending enough gas. The user needs to be informed that something went wrong

**Note**: We can optionally specify `gas` and `gasPrice` when `send` is being called
```soldiity
.send({
	from: userAccount,
	gas: 300000
})
```


### Calling `payable` functions
- We can do this by specifying the number of `Wei` we want to send in the transaction
- A `wei` is the smalled sub-unit of Ether
	- There are 10^18 `wei` is on `ether`

- There is a nice `web3` utility to use for this

`web3.utils.toWei("1")`

and this now can be used for `payable` functions using

```javascript
someContract.methods.someFunction(parameter)
.send({
	from: userAccount,
	value: web3js.utils.toWei("0.001", "ether")
})
```
4
### Subscribing to Events
- Recall that you can call an event by using the following

```solidity
event NewCar(uint16 year, string brand, string make);
```

In Web3.js, you can **subscribe** to an event so your web3 provider triggers some logic in the code 

```javascript
carContract.events.NewCar()
.on("data", function (event){

	let car = event.returnValues;
	// Now we can access the car variables that were send make
	let year = car.year;
	let make = car.make;
	let brand = car.brand;
})
```

### Using `indexed`
- In order to filer events and only listen for changes related to the current user, we can use the `indexed` keyword 

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _tokenId);
```

- Now we can filter using either the `_from` or `_to` variable

```javascript
carContract.events.Transfer({
	filter: {
		_to: userAccount
	}
})
.on("data", function(event){
	let data = event.returnValues;
})
```

### Querying past events
- We can even query past events using `getPastEvents` and use `fromBlock` and `toBlock` to give Solidity a time range for the event logs

```javascript
carContract.getPastEvents("Transfer", {
	fromBlock: 0,
	toBlock: "latest"
})
.then(function(events){
	// this will return an array of events
})
```

- Saving data to the blockchain is one of the most expensive operations in Solidity
- Using events is much cheaper in terms of gas
- Tradeoff is that events are not readable from inside the smart contract itself
	- But good to keep history of events that are recorded in the contract
