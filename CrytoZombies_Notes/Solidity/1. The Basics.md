### Contracts
- Solidity's code is encapsulated in **contracts**
- A `contract` is the fundamental building block of Ethereum application
	- All variables and function belong to a `contract`
- An empty contract looks like the following

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {

}

```

### Version Pragma
- All source code should start with  a `version pragma`
	- Declaration of the version of the solidity compiler this code should use
- For example to declare a compiler that supports versions in the range 0.5.0 (inclusive) to 0.6.0 (exclusive)


```solidity

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

}

```

### State Variables 
- State variables are stored in contract storage
	- They are being written to the Ethereum blockchain
	- Think of them like writing to a DB

- For example you can do the following with an unsigned integer
	- Non-negative value

```solidity

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

	uint myUnsignedInteger = 100;
}

```

- **Note** when declaring a variable with `uint` it is the same as declaring with `uint256` which is a 256-bit unsigned integer


### Math Operations
- Can do all of the following
- Addition `x+y`
- Subtraction `x-y`
- Multiplication `x*y`
- Division: `x/y`
- Modulus: `x % y`
- Expotential: `x ** y`

Example 

```solidity

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

	uint myUnsignedInteger = 100;
	uint powerInteger = myUnsignedInteger ** 16
}

```

### Structs
- Similar to classes
- Can define more complicated data types that contain their own attributes

```solidity

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

	uint myUnsignedInteger = 100;
	uint powerInteger = myUnsignedInteger ** 16;

	struct Person {
		string name;
		string eyeColor;
		uint age;
		fixed height;
	}

	
}

```


### Arrays
- Can used fixed or dynamic arrays
- Fixed `uint[2] fixedArray`
- Dynamic `uint[] dynamicArray`

- Use them for structs if need be
	- `Person[] population`

### Public Type
- Will automatically create getters and setters with variables that are decalred as `public`
- Something like `Person[] public population`
- For example

```solidity

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

	uint myUnsignedInteger = 100;
	uint powerInteger = myUnsignedInteger ** 16;
	
	struct Person {
		string name;
		string eyeColor;
		uint age;
		fixed height;
	}

	Person[] public population;	
}

```

### Function Declarations
- A function in solidity looks like the following

```solidity
function eatBurgers(string memory _name, uint _amount){

}
```

- The function's name is `eatBurgers`
	- Takes 2 paramters `string` and `uint`
	- We are also specifying where the `_name` variable is being stored which is in `memory`
		- **This is required for all reference types such as arrays, structs, mappings and string**
- So what is a reference?
	- Two ways in which you can pass an argument to a Solidity function
		1. By value
			- The compiler will create a new copy of the parameter's value and pass it to the function
			- Allows the function to change the value without worrying that about the initial value being changed
		2. By Reference
			- Function is called with a reference to the original variable. So if the variable changes within the function, the original variable will also change
	- **Note**: It is convention to start function parameter names with an underscore (`_`) to differentiate them from global variables

Example

```solidity

pragma solidity >= 0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

	uint myUnsignedInteger = 100;
	uint powerInteger = myUnsignedInteger ** 16;
	
	struct Person {
		string name;
		uint age;
	}

	Person[] public population;

	function createPerson(string memory _name, uint _age){
	
	}
}
```

### Working with Structs and Arrays
- We can create new instances of our structs using the following example 

```solidity
struct Wallet {
	uint value;
	string owner;
}

Wallet[] public wallets;

Wallet wallet = Wallet(100, "Teddy");

wallets.push(wallet);
```

- If we wanted to, we could simplify this even further to 

```solidity
struct Wallet {
	uint value;
	string owner;
}

Wallet[] public wallets;

wallets.push(Wallet(100, "Teddy"));
```


### Private / Public Functions
- In Solidity, function are `public` by default
	- Anyone (or any other contract) can call your contract's function and execute the code that is found
	- We don't always want this so we try to mark functions `private` by default
		- Make it `public` to expose it to the world

Example

```solidity
address[] public addresses // set this to a public variable

function _addToAddressArray(address memory _address) private {
	addresses.push(_address);
}
```

- **Note**
	- It is good convention to start private function names with an underscore `_`

### Return Values
- To return values from a function, the declaration is the following

```solidity
string greeting = "Wagwan Shorties";

function sayHelloInTorontoSlang() returns (string memory){
	return greeting;
}
```

### Function Modifiers
- The above function does not change anything so we can declare it as a `view`
```solidity
function sayHelloInTorontoSlang() view returns (string memory){
	return greeting
}
```
- Soldiity also have `pure` functions which don't access any data in the application

```solidity
function _multiply(uint a, uint b) private pure returns (uint){
	return a *b ;
}
```

### Keccak256
- Ethereum has a nice hash function called `keccak256` which is a version of SHA3
- Hash function maps an input into a random 256-bit hexadecimal number
- Slight change in the input will cause large change in hash
- This function expects a single paramter of type `bytes` so that we have to `pack` any parameters before calling `keccak256`

```solidity
// 588d88a3b5031c29cef648ab10fad98bf22abc5e3eaa300b59185fd9ca17de4b
keccak256(abi.encodePacked("hello my guy"));
// a67c7296cadfaf278c6b59e2f4b71532e87b6b3cf90f92f3707e28e407a48c6c
keccak256(abi.encodePacked("hello fun guy"));
```

### Typecasting
- Sometimes you need to convert between two datatypes 
- This is in order to line up with the output variable of some operation

```solidity
uint8 a = 5;
uint b = 6;
// this will throw an error, because a*b returns a uint, not uint8
uint8 c = a * b;
// this will work because we cast'd b to a uint8
uint8 c = a * uint8(b); 
```

### Example of above functionality 
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract PeopleGeneration{
	Person[] public population;
	
	function createRandomPerson(string memory _name) public {
		uint age = uint(keccack256(abi.encodePacked(_name)))
		Person person = Person("Ted", age);
		population.push(person);
	}
}
```
### Events
- Events are a way to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end
- These can be "listening" for certain events and take action when they happen
- Example in `solditity`

```solidity
// example.sol
event IntegersAdded (uint x, uint y, uint result);

function add (uint _x, uint _y) public returns (uint){
	uint result = _x + _y;
	emit IntegersAdded(_x, _y, result);
	return result;
}
```

```javascript
// example.js
YourContract.IntegersAdded(function(error,result){
	// do something with the result
})
```
