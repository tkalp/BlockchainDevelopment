### Chainlink & Oracles

- **Blockchain Oracles** are devices that connect our smart contracts with data and computation from the real worlds
- Example
	- Price data on currencies
	- Random number generators
	- Any other data we can think of
- Blockchains can't interact with the outside would
	- Intentionally isolated and deterministics by nature
- So all we have to do is trust one of these devices to honestly deliver our data and we are all set?
	- The quick answer is no
	- Not until there is **social trust** or you come up with a **decentralized version**
	- All this work to build smart contracts in a decentralized context, you would ruin all the effort by pulling your data from a centralized version
	- If all this data is only central to you, then its centralized
- When your smart contracts include data or computation from oracles, they are considered **hybrid smart contracts**
- Many of the most successful decentralized applications include data from the external world
